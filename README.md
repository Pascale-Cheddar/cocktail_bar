# COCKTAIL BAR WEB APP

## I Created basicaly an online shop where users could order cocktails ahead of time for there reservations at a bar, so when the customers arrive and take a seat at there tables, the bartender can do the order that took place earlier. 

### What can the Web application can do?
  - sign in / login / logout 
  - watch the user information
  - watch the order history

## specs 
  - prisma ORM with MYSQL
  - NodeJS
  - Vue.js
  - vuetify
    

### what could be the next steps? 
  - do table reservations
  - implement payment actions
  - add a user interface for the company or email notification for incoming reservations and / or orders, to devices that are already used, like the cash regristration (tablet)
  - add reCaptcha
